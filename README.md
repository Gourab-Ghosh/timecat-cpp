# timecat-cpp

This project is only made for my learning process on how to make a chess engine. So don't expect to have an easy process for compiling this project because it was never meant for others to use. You may also have to change the source code of the main function to test it. The project is shifted to https://github.com/Gourab-Ghosh/timecat-rs which you can compile and test easily.
